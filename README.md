## Flashcard Alternative: Studying Flashcards with Mini-games

### Proposal:

- ***What will the application do?***

The application would take in sets of inputs and flashcards.
The user would input terms and definitions and the application would store it.
Next, it would take in the flashcard inputs and use them as questions in a mini-game.
The faster you type out the terms, the more points you score.

- ***Who will use it?***

Students who need flashcards for studying can use this application to further improve their studying habits.
It is aimed to make studying more enjoyable, and hopefully be a more effective way to digest material and get it to stick in people's mind.

- ***Why is this project of interest to you?***

I personally use online flashcards as a way to study, but I found them tedious and repetitive.
It is difficult to retain the information solely by repetition. 
I feel like adding an engaging way or an alternative way to learn would improve my own ability to learn for other courses.

### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to add a flashcard to the set
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a flashcard from the set
- As a user, I want to be able to view preexisting flashcards in the set
- As a user, I want to be able to edit a preexisting flashcard in the set
- As a user, I want to be able to use a set of flashcards and play a speed mini-game.
- As a user, I want to be able to see by previous scores in the mini-game.
